Handle packages:
* Suggestion is to create packages as modules. This
  requires a map between type -> filename, so the type can be prefixed
  with the name of the file (module)

* Possibly add parameter to have full resolution on integer types, rather than mapping all to int

* Test for basic serialization / deserialization. Need to conjure a skeleton for this.
* Test module inclusion
* Test packages - esp. packages augmented by multiple included files


* Determine a suitable Polymorphic data type for errors - which allows for debugability

* 32 bit integers needs to be handled better.
* int32 and int64 have problems.
