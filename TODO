Handle packages:
* Packages should be a module.
* Suggestion is to create packages as modules. This
  requires a map between type -> filename, so the type can be prefixed
  with the name of the file (module)
* Test packages - esp. packages augmented by multiple included files
* int32 and int64 have problems.
* Make functions eagerly evaluated to speed up serialization and deserialization
* Add options to plugin to allow specify type derivers
* Handle service descriptions
* Add .travis CI
* Make repo public
* Handle map type. Map types should be unpacked into an assoc.
